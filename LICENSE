Copyright (c) 2023 QuSTEAM, a nonprofit incorporated in Ohio.

QuSTEAM is a nonprofit organization dedicated to increasing opportunities for education and research in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) at the undergraduate level. QuSTEAM grew out of an NSF Convergence Accelerator project among 70+ professors among 20+ academic insitutions with 30+ industry advisors to develop and pilot the first four courses in a quantum information minor. 

QuSTEAM the nonprofit aims to support and build the faculty community engaging in QISE education and research with a basket of services for faculty at member campuses. These services include dissemination of faculty contributions and campus-coordinated marketing for QISE. 

The aim in our IP agreement with member campuses is to: 
 * Facilitate dissemination (vs. profit or claim ownership)
 * Offer a "remixing" platform to attrbute work but increase multidisciplinary cross-talk and collaboration across institution types
 * Support research (both STEM and STEM ed) with course-integrated REU pathways for students into R1s and back to home campus research
 * Accelerate STEM education research by providing frameworks covering the range of approaches
 * Support course development and scaling across campuses. 
 
The QuSTEAM-Affiliate Agreement provides that:
 * Faculty can affiliate with QuSTEAM and participate in community discussions, collaborative development, and revision of course modules.

 * Faculty can contribute material copyright to themselves or their institution, with perpetual rights for QuSTEAM to use and distribute the material with attribution to contributing faculty at the module level.
